# RStudio-Learning-Series

Welcome to my Rstudio learning series repository! 

Here I will share scripts as a part of my learning journey of Rstudio. I won't be sharing on how to read your datasets into Rstudio, but rather the process of data exploration, manipulation & visualization. If you would like to correct or add more to what I have shared here, please let me know. I will be happy to discuss!
